        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring front end web developer who loves beautiful and functional web design. I currently live in the gorgeous mountains of Park City, Utah where I work as a graphic designer. I’m excited to bring my years of graphic design experience to the process of building beautiful websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional art director/graphic designer for over 15 years. I began my career in the ad agency world and was fortunate to work for a few wonderful creative directors who were great mentors that taught me the fundamentals of concepting and great design. After moving 5 times in 8 years, I have had to change jobs as well as adapt to the ever changing technological advances in the design world. In doing so, I have been learning to code and designing for the web. I have designed and even coded some web sites in the past but am eager to be expanding my skillset.</p>
